# Node-Express-MongoDb_APITutorial_StarterCode

> This starter code is made to pair with the Node/Express/MongoDb video tutorial series, for the MERN Web Development Course

## Setup Instructions
1. Run the `npm install` command from the integrated Visual Studio Code terminal to install dependencies from `package.json`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (same level as `index.js`)
3. Add a variable to the `.env` file: `PORT` (set equal to a port number of your choosing e.g 3010)
4. Add another variable to the `.env` file: `CONNECTION_STRING` (set equal to the MongoDb Atlas connection string from your database deployment)
5. Test the server with the command `npm start`
